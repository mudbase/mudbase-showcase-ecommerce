import PackageDescription

// This package is deliberately .xcodeproj-free. Xcode 14+ can open Package.swift directly and
// run an `executableTarget` that defines a SwiftUI `App`/`@main` as a real iOS app on a Simulator
// or device — it synthesizes the Info.plist/bundle at build time. See README.md "Why SPM, not an
// .xcodeproj" for the full rationale. `swift build` from the CLI also succeeds on macOS (the
// platforms list below just sets minimum deployment targets; no UIKit-only symbols are used
// anywhere in this target, so the same source compiles for both destinations).

        // affects the secondary macOS target used for `swift build` CLI verification (see the
        // note above); the real iOS 16 deployment target is unaffected.

        // This points at `../mudbase-sdk-swift`, NOT `../../mudbase-sdk/swift` directly, because
        // of a real SwiftPM constraint: a local path dependency's package "identity" is the last
        // path component of the given path string, with no way to override it. This package's own
        // directory is named `swift` (per this project's required layout) and the SDK repo's
        // Swift subdirectory is ALSO named `swift` — pointing straight at `mudbase-sdk/swift`
        // would give both packages the identity "swift" and SwiftPM's dependency resolution
        // silently conflates them ("product 'MudbaseSDK' ... not found in package 'MudbaseSDK'",
        // even though the product plainly exists — verified by reproducing it against the real
        // SDK checkout). `../mudbase-sdk-swift` is a symlink committed in the parent directory
        // (`mudbase-showcase-ecommerce/mudbase-sdk-swift -> ../mudbase-sdk/swift`) that exists
        // purely to give the dependency a distinct final path segment. See README.md "Known
        // limitations" for the full writeup.
